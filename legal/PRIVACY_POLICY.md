## How the App Works

### Offline Processing

All features of TexVoice operate entirely on your device:

- **Text-to-Speech Conversion**: All audio generation is performed locally using on-device AI models. No text is ever sent to external servers.
- **PDF Text Extraction**: PDF files are processed entirely on your device. The content never leaves your iPhone or iPad.
- **Audio Storage**: Generated audiobooks are stored locally in your device's app storage.

### No Account Required

TexVoice does not require you to create an account, sign in, or provide any personal information to use the App.

### No Internet Required

The App functions completely without an internet connection. All processing happens on-device.

## Data Storage

### Local Data

The following data is stored locally on your device:

- **Audiobooks**: Generated audio files are saved in the App's local storage
- **Library Metadata**: Information about your audiobooks (title, author, duration, voice used) is stored locally
- **App Preferences**: Your settings and preferences are stored locally

This data:
- Never leaves your device
- Is not accessible to us or any third party

## Third-Party Services

These components run entirely on your device and do not transmit any data externally.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this document.
